# Finite State Machine (FSM) in Java

A simple implementation of a Finite State Machine using Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java.  
This project simulates the behavior of a **Toaster** with multiple states (e.g., Idle, Toasting, Done, Error) to demonstrate concepts in **Discrete Mathematics** and **Software Design**.
